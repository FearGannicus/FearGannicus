### Hey! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gannicus.

*I've recently been spending my time working on the business side of my [Exordium](https://github.com/exordium-dev) project. My plan for Exordium is to create an open source virtual private networking software and encrypted email service. If you're interested in these projects, please check out the [exordium website](https://exordium.org) or [discord server](https://discord.exordium.org)! It would also mean a lot if you [helped support me](https://github.com/sponsors/FearGannicus).*

ðŸ’» On Github, you can find me working on;
- [Exordium](https://github.com/exordium-dev) projects, mainly a [virtual private networking project](https://exordium.org), where all profits gained will go towards environmental protections.
- Releasing web development projects, like templates or angular websites. 

ðŸŒ² Outside of Github, you can find me;
- Producing music on [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/gannicusmusic).
- Getting in touch with [nature and exploring the outdoors](https://www.instagram.com/justscottish/). 
- Streaming or watching my mates on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/feargannicus).
