### Hey! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gannicus.
*I'm in private policing, but on my sparetime I'm someone who enjoys streaming, programming, producing music and chilling in the outdoors. Below you can find some more information on what I've been up to recently. Thanks for coming by and feel free to message me anytime.*

ðŸ’» On Github, you can find me working on;
- [Exordium](https://github.com/exordium-dev) projects, mainly a [virtual private networking project](https://exordium.org), where all profits gained will go towards environmental protections.
- Releasing web development projects, like templates or angular websites. 

ðŸŒ² Outside of Github, you can find me;
- Producing music on [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/feargannicus).
- Getting in touch with [nature and exploring the outdoors](https://www.instagram.com/justscottish/). 
- Streaming or watching my mates on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/feargannicus).
